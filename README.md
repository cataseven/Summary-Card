# Summary Card for Home Assistant

[Build Status] [Version] [License]

Transform your Home Assistant dashboard from a simple list of entities into a smart, dynamic, "at-a-glance" overview of your entire home. The **Summary Card** is your canvas for creativity, allowing you to group entities by domain (lights, switches, sensors, etc.) and create a grid of cards that dynamically change their appearance based on the state of your devices.

This isn't just another card; it's a tool to build a dashboard that truly understands and reflects the state of your home. You control the layout, the logic, and the look. Unleash your creativity and design a control panel that is uniquely yours.



## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Dynamic Grid Layout:** Arrange your cards in any number of columns and set a uniform height for a clean, organized look.
-   **Conditional Styling:** Define rules to change a card's text, icon, and color based on entity states. For example, "Show a green icon if all lights are off" or "Show an orange icon and display the count if any lights are on."
-   **Advanced Entity Filtering:** Summarize an entire domain, or drill down by including or excluding specific entities to create highly focused summary cards.
-   **Specialized Clock Card:** Add a sleek, modern, real-time clock to your dashboard.
-   **User-Friendly Visual Editor:** Configure everything through the UI without needing to write a single line of YAML. Add new cards, define conditions, and see your changes in real-time.
-   **Auto-Discovery on First Use:** When you first add the card, it intelligently scans your Home Assistant instance and creates a default configuration based on the domains you actually use.

### The `cards` Array

Each item in the `cards` list defines a single card in your grid. There are two main types of cards:

#### 1. Domain Card

This is the standard card for summarizing a group of entities.

| Key       | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                             |
| :-------- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `domain`  | string | Yes      | The domain of entities to summarize (e.g., `light`, `switch`, `climate`).                               |
| `name`    | string | No       | A title for the card, mainly for identification in the editor.                                          |
| `include` | list   | No       | A list of `entity_id`s. If provided, **only** these entities will be considered from the domain.         |
| `exclude` | list   | No       | A list of `entity_id`s. These entities will be ignored from the domain.                                 |
| `styles`  | list   | Yes      | A list of conditional styling rules that determine the card's appearance.                               |

#### 2. Clock Card

A special card for displaying the current time.

| Key      | Type   | Required | Description                                  |
| :------- | :----- | :------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `domain` | string | Yes      | Must be `clock`.                             |
| `color`  | string | No       | Sets the color for the icon and its backdrop. |

---

### The `styles` Array - The Heart of Creativity ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is where the magic happens. For each Domain Card, you define a list of style rules. The card evaluates these rules from top to bottom and applies the **first rule that matches the current state**. This creates a priority system for your styles.

| Key              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :----- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `condition`      | string | Yes      | The condition that must be met for this style to be applied.                                                                                                            |
| `text`           | string | No       | The primary text to display on the card when the condition is met.                                                                                                      |
| `secondary_text` | string | No       | The smaller, secondary text to display on the card.                                                                                                                     |
| `icon`           | string | No       | The Material Design Icon to display (e.g., `mdi:lightbulb-on`).                                                                                                         |
| `color`          | string | No       | The color for the icon and its backdrop (e.g., `orange`, `green`, `dodgerblue`, `#FF5733`).                                                                              |

#### Available Conditions (`condition`)

| Condition         | Description                                                               | Practical Use Case Example                                |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `any_active`      | True if at least one entity is active (e.g., a light is 'on').            | "Are any of the media players currently playing?"         |
| `all_inactive`    | True if **all** entities are inactive (and none are unavailable).         | "Are all the windows and doors closed?"                   |
| `any_unavailable` | True if at least one entity is in the 'unavailable' state.                | "Is one of my smart plugs offline?" (Highest priority rule) |
| `any_inactive`    | True if at least one entity is inactive.                                  | "Are any of the fans currently off?"                      |
| `all_active`      | True if **all** entities are active.                                      | "Is the whole house alarm system fully armed?"            |

#### Dynamic Text Placeholders

You can make your `text` and `secondary_text` fields dynamic by using these placeholders. They will be automatically replaced with live counts.

-   `{active_count}`: The number of active entities.
-   `{inactive_count}`: The number of inactive entities.
-   `{unavailable_count}`: The number of unavailable entities.

### Example 2: Advanced "Home Status" Dashboard

This example demonstrates filtering, multiple conditions, and a mix of card types for a comprehensive overview.

```yaml
type: custom:summary-card
columns: 4
row_height: 95px
cards:
  # Card 1: A stylish clock for context
  - domain: clock
    color: 'var(--primary-color)' # Use theme's primary color

  - domain: person
    name: People
    styles:
      # Rule 1: Show how many people are home
      - condition: any_active # For 'person' domain, 'home' is the active state
        text: '{active_count} at Home'
        icon: mdi:home-account
        color: '#4CAF50' # Green
      # Rule 2: If no one is home, show this
      - condition: all_inactive

        icon: mdi:home-export-outline
        color: '#FF9800' # Orange

  # Card 3: A security overview for doors and windows
  - domain: binary_sensor
    name: Security
    # We only want to see sensors that report open/close states
    include:
      - binary_sensor.front_door
      - binary_sensor.back_door
      - binary_sensor.living_room_window
    styles:
      - condition: any_active # 'on' state means a door/window is open
        text: '{active_count} Open!'
        secondary_text: Unsecured
        icon: mdi:shield-alert
        color: 'crimson'

  # Card 4: Media Players - but ignore the one in the guest room
  - domain: media_player
    name: Media
    exclude:
      - media_player.guest_room_display

        color: 'var(--secondary-text-color)'
```

### Example 3: Creative Use Case - Plant Care Dashboard
Do you have plant moisture sensors? You can create a card to tell you when your plants are thirsty! This assumes your moisture sensors are binary_sensors that are 'on' (active) when the plant is dry.

```yaml
type: custom:summary-card
columns: 1
cards:
  - domain: binary_sensor
    name: Plant Care
    # Assuming your plant sensors all have 'moisture' in their entity_id
    # You would use the 'include' property to list them specifically.
    include:
      - binary_sensor.fiddle_leaf_fig_moisture
      - binary_sensor.snake_plant_moisture
      - binary_sensor.monstera_moisture
    styles:
      - condition: any_active # 'on' means a plant is dry and needs water
        text: '{active_count} Thirsty Plant(s)'
        secondary_text: Time to get the watering can!
        icon: mdi:water-alert
        color: '#E53935' # Red
      - condition: all_inactive
        text: Plants are Happy
        secondary_text: All watered and content
        icon: mdi:leaf
        color: '#388E3C' # Green
```
